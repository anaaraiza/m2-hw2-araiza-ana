    <h1>Hello! My name is Ana Araiza.</h1>
        <p>Let me tell you a little bit about myself! </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>These are some of my hobbies and interests, and other things that are significant to who I am:
        <ol>
            <li> Probably the first thing my friends and family think about when they think of me: I am a BIG dog girl! I have a 2 year old golden retriever named Addie and I am proudly the definition of Crazy Dog Mom.</li>
            <li> Along the same line, I used to be a volunteer puppy raiser for <a href="https://canine.org/">Canine Companions</a>, a service dog non-profit. That's how Addie came into my life! She is a former service dog in training, turned forever pet.</li>
            <li> I love reading! The last book I read was Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir.</li>
            <li> I need to strategically plan when I will be starting a new TV show, because I will binge it. My current obsession is Severance</li>
            <li> I love all things arts and crafts, and have tried many things in this realm. From sewing to polymer clay, to wood burning, etc.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

 <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
    <p>Admittedly, I am still very much figuring things out. It is one of the reasons why I am in this program. I know I want to be in the marketing space. Some of the careers that stand out to me, in no particular order, are:
        <ul>
            <li> UX Strategist</li>
            <li> UX Designer</li>
            <li> Graphic Designer</li>
            <li> Among other paths that I don't yet know enough about but I am excited to learn more about through the course of my program.</li>
        </ul>
